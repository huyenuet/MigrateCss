# MigrateCss
This project was used for demonstration purposes in my Thesis submitted in 2018

# Objectives
- Group similar CSS code lines from different code blocks into one place, and reduce the duplicated code lines. As a consequence, it reduces the size of CSS files.
- This practice proves particularly beneficial for projects containing extensive CSS code.
